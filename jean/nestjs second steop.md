	the second step of this jouney should be to make a basic
	interaction  between a database and the frontend through prisma since you
	dont want to use  raw connector noar write query by hand right   one would 
	be to add element to the database retrieve data and delete data? 
	after that try to interact with the 42  api to be able to do auth  and create
	and instance of a  user that can store data about the user
	and create a profile ...
